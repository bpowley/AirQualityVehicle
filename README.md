# AirQualityVehicle
CIS320 Group Project

Project Proposal
 
Student Name: Ian Aksland, Kelyn Shaffner, Brendon Powley, and Tanner  Kinsey               Date:   2/4/18
 
Potential Project Name: Air Quality Safety Vehicle
 
Project Sponsor’s Name, Organization, and Contact Information:
Dr. Jay Ham, Colorado State University Professor, Jay.Ham@ColoState.edu
 
Justification or Reason for the Project:
Seems awesome, and materials for this type of project have gone way down. Additionally, a bunch of capabilities can be added. Having manual and automated control is something to investigate. As it drives it will sense compounds in the air as well as the humidity and temperature. Having it drive on its own seems ideal but may not be realistic inside the time constraints. This could in the future help detect a problem before it becomes a safety issue.
 
Main Project Deliverables:
-The vehicle
-Software code
-Planning documents
-Cost sheet
 
Required Team Skills:
-Intermediate C++ based language understanding
-Automation
-Communication
-Time management
-Reliability
-Creativity
 
Main Team Tasks/Roles:
-Software
-Bluetooth Control
-Vehicle chassis
-Vehicle motor/wheel operation
-Power
-Additional sensors/ function of car (could include sonar to prevent from hitting walls, GPS location, VOC detection (gas leak), air temperature, relative humidity, methane gas, barometric pressure…)
